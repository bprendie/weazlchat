# WeazlChat

WeazlChat is a private local-first AI chat TUI for vLLM and Ollama servers.

## Defaults

On first launch, WeazlChat writes `~/.config/weazlchat/config.json` with:

- `local-vllm`: `http://localhost:8000`
- model: `local-model`
- `local-ollama`: `http://localhost:11434`

The endpoint and model are read from config at runtime, not hardcoded into the chat client.

## Run

```sh
go run ./cmd/weazlchat
```

The first run asks you to create a local history password. Session history and workspace saves are stored in SQLite with a bcrypt-protected vault and AES-GCM encrypted payloads.

## Keys

- `enter`: send message or select session
- `ctrl+n`: new session
- `ctrl+r`: resume from session history
- `ctrl+s`: save current workspace view
- `ctrl+w`: list workspace saves
- `esc`: back to chat
- `ctrl+c`: quit
